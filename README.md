PURPOSE 
The purpose of developing this “Mobile Personal Assistant” is to help the students, teachers, corporate professionals or businessmen, with their time management, to help them focus more on their daily endeavours and to assist them with their important calls being missed (if any).
According to Some Statistics:-
80% of all business regarding communications take place over the phone.
85% of people whose calls are not answered will not call back.

	                 As peculiar it may seem, but yes missed calls can somehow become a “problem.”

SCOPE 
It will integrate benefits like putting a stop on the need to be on your mobile all day long and focus on your work without being worried about the important calls being missed. It will help you manage your calls with rescheduling them and posting a reminder for the important calls(if any.) and may lead you to follow your timetable for the day to get the job well done.
